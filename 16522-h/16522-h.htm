<p>With this number we begin on the last quarter of the year 1875; and we
have the pleasure of informing our host of readers, young and old, that
the prospects of "The Nursery" were never so encouraging as now. It has
not only held its own during these hard times, but gone on increasing.
Canvassers may take hold of it with the assurance that future numbers
will be improvements even on the past.</p>

<p>"Playing the King," in our present number, will be a good piece for
humorous declamation at school. Both the artist and the poet have done
their work well.</p>

<p>For the coming holidays, there will be no juvenile work equal in
attraction to the "NURSERY PRIMER," which will now soon be ready. It
will be the best book for beginners ever got up. Already we have
received numerous orders for it, to which we shall soon respond.</p>

<p>"The Easy Book" and "The Beautiful Book" ought to be remembered by
dealers ordering for the holidays. These books have only to be seen to
be appreciated. The Nursery series of books is allowed to be the best
for the purpose designed, namely, the teaching of children to read,
<i>chiefly by their own efforts</i>, that has ever appeared.</p>

<p>Unaccepted articles will be returned to the writers <i>if stamps are sent
with them</i> to pay return postage. Manuscripts not so accompanied will
not be preserved, and subsequent requests for their return cannot be
complied with.</p>

<span class="i0">H merry, merry sports had we, last summer on the beach,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Oliver and I, with Uncle Sam to teach!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, clad in our bathing-suits, we'd join our hands, all four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;And rush into the water, or run along the shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wet sand, how it glistened on the sunny summer day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the waves would chase us back, as if they were in play!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, on the horizon blue, a sail we would espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How "Ship ahoy!" or "Whither bound?" we all of us would cry!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The white, white sand, so smooth and hard, oh what a place for fun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no one by to check our screams, or say, "Now, pray, have done!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-birds, not at all disturbed by all our mirthful noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would cry to us, as if they said, "Shout on, shout on, my boys!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes we'd seek for flattened stones, and skim them o'er the waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then go where, in the piled-up rocks, the sea had hollowed caves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sit and feel the cooling breeze in silent happiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hunt for seaweed in the clefts, and take it home to press.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And well do I remember there a little shallow creek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where we would go and sail our ships, at least three times a week:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We loaded them with cargoes rich, and sent them all to Spain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back they came with heavy freights, by which we made much gain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! pleasant pastimes on the beach, how often I recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean grand, the distant sails, the rocks, the lighthouse tall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do not fade, these pictures bright, from memory's inner view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And age itself shall never dim their colors ever new.<br /></span>

<h3><a name="MABEL_AND_HER_FRIEND_CARLO" id="MABEL_AND_HER_FRIEND_CARLO"></a>MABEL AND HER FRIEND CARLO.</h3>

<p>Mabel lives on a hill, quite near a beautiful lake, and is very fond of
going with her papa to take a row on the water. Sometimes they visit the
woods on the other side of the lake, and pick wild flowers, or go where
the water-lilies grow, near the shore, and gather a bunch of the pretty
white blossoms.</p>

<p>But I must tell about Mabel's friend Carlo. He is a large shaggy dog,
owned by a gentleman who lives near. Although quite a young dog, he
knows a great deal. He is very fond of water, and is wild with delight
at the prospect of a swim.</p>

<p>His master owns a large sail-boat, and, as the water near the shore is
not deep, he has to use a small boat to reach it. When Carlo sees him
take down the oar from its place in <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>the yard, he runs up, and takes it
in his mouth, as much as to say, "Let me carry that for you, master."
Then he trots down the hill with the oar, feeling very proud that he is
allowed to carry it.</p>

<p>One day, Carlo took hold of the rope with his teeth, and drew the small
boat to the shore; so that his master, who was in it, did not have to
use the oar.</p>

<p>Mabel loves Carlo very much; and, although he is a large dog, he knows
that he must play very gently with little boys and girls, and not hurt
them with his great paws.</p>

<h3><a name="A_TRUE_ANTELOPE_STORY" id="A_TRUE_ANTELOPE_STORY"></a>A TRUE ANTELOPE STORY.</h3>


<p>Some time ago, I told the readers of "The Nursery" about catching a
buffalo-calf. I will now tell them about a young antelope which we
caught, and another which we almost caught.</p>

<p>Tip and I were in that part of Western Kansas which is left blank on the
maps. Two hunters, Thompson and Hughes, had joined us; and we were
coming back from a buffalo-chase. We had been crawling lazily along,
over prairie, through valley, up and down hill, since sunrise, and it
was now nearly noon.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, from a clump of tall grass near us, up sprung an
antelope and a pair of beautiful fawns. Like a flash, the old one and
one of the fawns started over the brow of the ridge on which they were
lying; while the other little fellow began running around in a circle,
as you have seen ponies do at the circus, bleating as hard as he could.</p>

<p>The boys leaped from the wagons in an instant, while I remained to hold
the horses. Ranging themselves around the circle, the three hunters
every now and then, dashed headlong after the fawn as he flew past; but
missed him by a rod or more every time.</p>

<p>Our dog Landy, also, was on hand for the fun; and it was a laughable
sight to see the great awkward fellow straining every nerve to overtake
the little streak of animated lightning that flashed before him. Landy
was a Newfoundland shepherd, and I knew that nothing could induce him to
hurt the fawn if he should catch him.</p>

<p>While I was watching the sport, and laughing at the drollery of it, all
at once I heard a stamping on the other side of the wagon, and, stepping
quickly around the horses' heads, I saw the old doe, and a buck and doe
with her.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-09.jpg"><img src="images/illus-09-tb.jpg" alt="A TRUE ANTELOPE STORY." title="A TRUE ANTELOPE STORY." /></a></div>
<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></p>

<p>As the fawn came bounding along the circle, the buck and does, bleating
anxiously, darted in ahead of him, rushing right by the men and dog.
Never stopping an instant, the big buck led the way, the does and fawn
followed; and, before you could say "Jack Robinson," they were "over the
hills, and far away."</p>

<p>This was the antelope that we <i>almost</i> caught. The boys came back to the
wagons, thoroughly fagged out, and looking painfully silly.</p>

<p>Again we drove along, but had not proceeded more than a mile or two,
when up sprung another old doe, and ran toward Landy, stamping her
fore-foot fiercely. Of course the foolish dog took after her as hard as
he could go,&mdash;just as she wanted him to do; and a fine chase she led
him, always taking care not to leave him so far behind as to discourage
him, and make him turn back.</p>

<p><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>We knew at once by her actions that she had a fawn near there; and so,
while she was leading Landy away from it, we set about hunting it up. In
a few minutes, I came across the little slender-legged beauty, snugly
curled up under a tuft of grass. As I came upon him, he dashed out of
cover with a shrill, plaintive little "baa-baa, baa-baa," and, as fawns
always do in such cases, began running in a small circle.</p>

<p>Landy, disgusted with his hopeless chase, came trotting back, and at
once struck in after the fawn. This one was not so fleet as the other;
and by and by Landy overtook him, and tried to stop him by pushing him
over with his nose. This frightened the fawn so badly, that he made
direct for Tip, who was squatting in the long grass in wait for him, and
rushed joyfully into his arms.</p>

<p>We took the bright-eyed little thing into the wagon, and by night he was
so tame, that he would follow us around; and, when we lay down to sleep
on the ground, I gave him a corner of my blanket for a bed. At last we
got back to Thompson's log-house, which stood near the timber; and, when
we went away we gave the fawn to his two little girls. I would really
like to know what ever became of it.</p>

<h3><a name="A_COUNCIL_OF_HORSES" id="A_COUNCIL_OF_HORSES"></a>A COUNCIL OF HORSES.</h3>


<p>On the large plains of South America, horses run wild in great numbers.
They are caught by means of a lasso, which is a rope with a noose at one
end. This is thrown with great dexterity over the neck of the wild
horse.</p>

<p>The artist has called the picture which we here present "A Council of
Horses." Do they not look as if they were taking advice of one another?
The white horse, with his erect neck and head, seems to be the leader,
or chief. He is willing to hear what the others may have to say; but he
means that they shall follow him, after all.</p>

<p>And can horses really make known their wishes to one another? It would
almost seem so, though we cannot prove it. Wild horses choose their own
chiefs, and these give the signal of departure. If any extraordinary
object appears, the chief commands a halt. He goes to discover what it
is, and, after his return, gives, by neighing, the signal of confidence,
of flight, or of combat.</p>

<p>Five sorts of neighing may be noticed: that of joyfulness, of desire, of
anger, of fear, and of sorrow. A feeling peculiar to the horse is
emulation. Whoever has witnessed a horse-race can understand the ardor,
vehemence, and struggle for victory, which excite the energies of both
horses and men. The animals have often tried to hold their rivals back
by the teeth. This has been known to happen when the horses are left
entirely to themselves, as on some of the Italian race-courses, where
the horses run without riders.</p>

<p>The horse has a strong memory. Franklin relates, that he had a horse
that conducted him through a hilly country where it was difficult to
find the road. Every time Franklin himself was unable to tell which road
to take, he would <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>leave the reins on the horse's neck, and the good

<p>The noblest conquest that man ever made over the animal creation is that
of the horse. Every thing in him breathes out vivacity and energy. That
need of continual movement, that impatience during repose, that nervous
motion of the lips, that stamping of the feet, all indicate a pressing
need of activity.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PET_OF_THE_SHIP" id="THE_PET_OF_THE_SHIP"></a>THE PET OF THE SHIP.</h3>

<h3>PART III.</h3>


<p>One day when the ship was at anchor in one of the ports on the western
coast of South America, a number of sheep were brought on board. Whether
Dennis regarded them as intruders, or not, I cannot say; but his
treatment of them was anything but kind.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus-14.png" alt="PIG" title="PIG" /></div>

<p>The poor sheep stood in great fear of him, and fled in alarm whenever he
made a charge at them. One by one they began to disappear; and, at last,
only one&mdash;a little fellow whom the sailors afterward named Billy&mdash;was
left.</p>

<p>He was greatly distressed when the last of his companions was taken
away, and ran bleating about the deck in search of him. To add to his
troubles, that dreadful bully Dennis, who had been watching him for some
time, was now coming towards him. He was frightened nearly to death.</p>

<p>What must have been his delight when he saw in Dennis's eyes a look of
pity, and heard his friendly grunt! I don't know what Dennis said; but I
do know, that, half an hour afterwards, Billy had forgotten all about
his troubles, and was lying down with his head resting in Dennis's fat
neck.</p>

<p>Even the rough sailors were pleased; and as they looked <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>at Dennis, who
was fast asleep, they said, "Now that was a fine thing, and Dennis was
the pig to do it. He was willing to fight with a flock of sheep; but,
when it came to quarrelling with one little fellow, he was too noble for
that."</p>

<p>Thenceforth Dennis and Billy were inseparable, and no pair ever agreed
better. There were times, however, when Dennis seemed a little vexed
with Billy, though he was always as kind as possible. I will tell you of
an instance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-15.jpg"><img src="images/illus-15-tb.jpg" alt="SAILORS WITH THE PETS" title="SAILORS WITH THE PETS" /></a></div>

<p>Billy would always watch the crowd about Dennis, when the latter was
taking his bath, with a great deal of anxiety; and, if Dennis did not
appear very shortly, he would begin bleating loudly.</p>

<p>This would disgust Dennis immensely; but he couldn't bear to think that
Billy's feelings were hurt: so he would leave his nice bath, and push
his way through the men, until Billy could see him. Then he would return
to the pump, grunting in a manner that plainly showed his feelings.</p>

<p><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>He was certainly saying, "I do wish that sheep had a little more of the
pig about him. If I am out of his sight for a moment, he begins to cry,
and take on in such a manner, that I must show myself to him; and then I
have all the trouble of making the sailors pump again."</p>

<p>But the sailors only waited to make Dennis beg a little. They had no
idea of not pumping again. They were always pleased when he showed so
much good feeling for Billy; and generally he got a larger allowance of
water to pay for it.</p>

<p>I believe that Dennis was not living when the ship reached California.
That ever he became food for his sailor friends no one can imagine.
Therefore his fate must remain a mystery, unless some of my readers
happen to know one of the crew of "The Vanderbilt," and can learn from
him something on the subject.</p>

<p>If they can, there are many, no doubt, who would be glad to hear from
them in the pages of "The Nursery." My little girls would, at least.
But, probably, Dennis has more of a place in their thoughts than he can
have in those of others.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_UNMOTHERLY_HEN" id="THE_UNMOTHERLY_HEN"></a>THE UNMOTHERLY HEN.</h3>


<p>Now, my dear children, if you will be very quiet, I will tell you a true
story, which I sometimes tell my little daughter Fanny and her cousin
Grace, when they climb up on my knees just before going to bed.</p>

<p>On a farm near Fishkill, where Fanny's Aunt Jane lives, they raise a
great many chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. When I was a boy, ever
so many years ago, I used to have great fun hunting for eggs through the
hay and straw in the barns.</p>

<p>Well, last year one of the hens, instead of laying her eggs in the
hen-house or barn, like a well-mannered hen, stole off under a
wood-pile, and was not seen for three weeks, when she made her
appearance with a fine brood of chickens. To keep her from straying away
again, she was put into a coop. For several days, she was a good mother
to her children; <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>but, after a week or so, she began to act very
strangely, and, when her children came near her, she would peck and
abuse them.</p>

<p>Would you believe it, children? in one day, this unmotherly hen had
pecked all but one of her chickens to death; and, when Aunt Jane found
this poor chap, he had but one eye, and all the toes were gone from one
foot; so that he had to stand on the other. At first, Aunt Jane thought
it would be a mercy to kill the little fellow, and put him out of pain;
but she finally determined that she would try to cure him.</p>

<p>So she took him into the kitchen, and made him quite comfortable in a
box half filled with cotton-batting, and placed near the stove. She gave
him cracked-corn to eat, and plenty of water to drink, and, after a
while, he got so strong, that he hopped out of the box, and was just as
jolly a chicken as he could be, with only one eye to see with, and only
one foot and the stump of another to walk on.</p>

<p>Still he would not go out and play with other chickens of his age, but
persisted in hanging around the kitchen. One morning, when Aunt Jane
went into the breakfast-room, she found him on the table, helping
himself from a dish of stewed potatoes. Such impudence could no longer
be tolerated: so the saucy little cripple was banished to the barnyard
to learn manners.</p>

<p>And what do you think became of the unmotherly hen? She lost all her
friends. She was despised and hated by everybody on the farm. She was
pointed at as "that cruel, speckled hen," until life became a burden to
her. She was not permitted to have any more chickens. When the cold
weather came, she was sent to a poor woman for a thanksgiving dinner;
and it is to be hoped that all the hens in the barnyard took warning
from her fate.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CHILDRENS_VISIT_TO_THE_LIGHTHOUSE" id="THE_CHILDRENS_VISIT_TO_THE_LIGHTHOUSE"></a>THE CHILDREN'S VISIT TO THE LIGHTHOUSE.</h3>


<p>Charlie and Georgie were staying at Appledore, one of the Isles of
Shoals, and, with two other little children, had many nice times fishing
and sailing.</p>

<p>The lighthouse is on White Island, which, as you see in the picture, is
a lonely and rocky place. It would be very dangerous for any ship to
come in from sea on that part of the coast, if it were not for the
friendly warning of the brilliant light.</p>

<p>One warm, sunny morning, Charlie and Georgie, with their papa and mamma,
and their two little friends, rowed across from Appledore, and landed on
the pebbly beach of White Island. Here the children ran about, and
picked up stones until they were tired; and then the whole party seated
themselves on some shaded rocks, and ate their lunch of crackers and
bananas.</p>

<p>While they were eating, an old white dog, belonging to the lighthouse
keeper, came up and made their acquaintance. Georgie shared his cake
with him; and it was amusing to see the old dog watching with eager eyes
every piece that went into any mouth but his own.</p>

<p>When lunch was over, the two older children, Charlie and Anna, led the
way; and all were soon climbing the winding stairs in the lighthouse
tower. When they reached the top, they found themselves in a small room
with windows on every side, and the great lamp in the centre. The
lantern is made of red-and-white glass, and turns around, so that first
a red, and then a white, light may be seen far out at sea.</p>

<p>The keeper explained how, after lighting the lamp, he <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>wound up the
machinery which caused the lamp to revolve; and told them of the lonely
hours he had spent in the little room below the lamp, while the waves
dashed, and the storm beat outside.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-21.jpg"><img src="images/illus-21-tb.jpg" alt="TRIP TO THE LIGHTHOUSE" title="TRIP TO THE LIGHTHOUSE" /></a></div>

<p>For many weeks in the winter he lives there all by himself, and sees no
one; but, in the summer time, there is hardly a day when he does not
have a boat full of visitors. He always gives them a hearty welcome, and
makes himself very agreeable. I suppose he feels as though he must make
the most of society while he can get it.</p>

<p>The children listened to his talk with great interest. With many thanks
for his kind attentions, they bade him "Good-by," and, intent on
collecting shells on another island near, stepped into their boat, and
were rowed away, leaving the man and his friendly dog to enjoy each
other's company.</p>

<div style="font-size:x-large">
<p>When Edward was eight years old, his mother told him he might go with
John, the hired man, to drive the cows from the pasture. How happy the
little boy was!</p>

<p>Every day he would be ready as soon as John gave the word; and off they
would go, through the woods, over hills and rocks, and gurgling brooks,
wherever the ding-dong of the distant cow-bells pointed the way.</p>

<p>Sometimes they had a long search before they could find all the cows;
for the pasture <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>was very large, and the cows would wander about in
every part of it, to find the best feeding-places.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-23.jpg"><img src="images/illus-23-tb.jpg" alt="COW" title="COW" /></a></div>

<p>On the way home, Edward <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>would run ahead of the cows, and open the bars;
and sometimes he would sit on the wall, and pat each cow as she came
through.</p>

<p>When the cows reached the barnyard, Edward would help milk. There was
one old cow which he called his own, and which he named Carrie. She
always stood very still while being milked, and that was one reason why
he liked her better than any of the rest.</p>

<p>After milking, he helped John to carry in the milk, and his mother often
gave him a mug full. Oh, how nice it was!</p>

<h3><a name="ELSIES_DUCKS" id="ELSIES_DUCKS"></a>ELSIE'S DUCKS.</h3>


<p>Elsie was the daughter of poor parents, who lived on the borders of a
lake. Once, when she was very ill with a fever, a good neighbor made her
a present of three young ducks. Elsie was much pleased, and she soon
began to get well.</p>

<p>Her mother would bring a large tub of water into the room where the
little invalid lay; and the three ducks would swim about, and swallow
the crumbs which Elsie threw to them.</p>

<p>As soon as she got well, she would drive the ducks down to the lake, and
let them swim. They were so tame, that they would come out of the water
at her call.</p>

<p>Sometimes her father and the rest of the family would get into a boat,
and he would row across the lake to the <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>opposite side, where some
families lived who employed Elsie's mother to wash clothes for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus-27.png"><img src="images/illus-27-tb.png" alt="TRIP TO THE LIGHTHOUSE" title="TRIP TO THE LIGHTHOUSE" /></a></div>

<p>At these times, the three ducks would follow the boat. Perhaps they did
not like to trust their dear Elsie on the water, unless they were by to
help her in case of need.</p>

<p>Sometimes old and young would join in a song; and then far over the lake
would be heard the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come to the sunset tree, the day is past and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodman's axe lies free, and the reaper's task is done."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a very pretty sight, on a summer evening, when the bright clouds
over the setting sun threw their tints on the water, to see the ducks
swimming by the side of the little boat which contained Elsie and the
rest of the family. It was so pretty a sight, that a good artist made a
picture of the scene. We give you a copy of it here.</p>

<h3><a name="FISHING_FOR_TROUT" id="FISHING_FOR_TROUT"></a>FISHING FOR TROUT.</h3>


<p>The trout belongs to the salmon family. Its flesh is generally of a pale
pink or yellow color. It is one of the handsomest fish to be found in
our waters. The variations of its tints are very beautiful; and the red
spots on its skin distinguish it from common fish.</p>

<p>I never had much luck in catching trout. One summer I went from the city
to try the trout-streams in Northern New York. I had a handsome rod, and
a line nicely baited with an artificial fly; but, though I was very
persevering, my success was small.</p>

<p>I remember sitting for hours on the slender bridge just below the Upper
Cascades of Buttermilk Fall, represented <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>in the picture; but my
patience was not rewarded by the capture of a single trout. I was sorry
for this; for I had depended on getting one for my dinner.</p>

<p>As I was about retiring, a little barefoot fellow, about twelve years
old, came along with a common fishing-pole, and hook baited with a worm,
and said, "Mister, I'll catch a trout for you."&mdash;"Do it, then," said I.</p>

<p>He threw his line over a smooth spot in the pool below; and, before he
had been at it five minutes, he pulled up a noble trout, large enough
for a good dinner. Another and another were pulled up in quick
succession. I did not know what to make of it; for I thought I had
fished in a very scientific way.</p>

<p>"Teach me the knack," said I. "Oh, it can't be taught," replied the boy.
"Well, here is a dime for your trouble," said I, putting the fish into
my pail. "Do you suppose I take pay for what I do for sport, mister?"
said little barefoot, waving back my hand with the air of a prince.</p>

<p>After that we became good friends, and met often at the bridge; but I
never could learn his knack of catching trout.</p>

I mean myself. Carlo has the advantage of the other two of us sometimes;
for he has four legs, and can run faster than either John or I. But then
we can do a great many things that Carlo cannot do.</p>

<p>For example, John and I sometimes take our books, and sit down on the
rocks in the wood, under the thick trees, and read stories. And then
Carlo will lie down at our feet, and go to sleep; for he cannot
understand the nice stories which the other two friends enjoy so much.</p>

<p>But wait till we go into the swamps after berries, or into the
wood-borders after hazel-nuts. Then Carlo is wide awake, you may be
sure. If he sees a snake, what a noise he makes! We can always tell by
the tone of his bark when he has found a snake.</p>

<p>And, when John climbs a tree after nuts, how anxiously Carlo will stand
underneath and watch him, so afraid is <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>he that the little boy will get
a fall! And how the good dog will jump and show his pleasure when he
sees John once more safe on the firm ground!</p>

<p>Oh! we have fine times together, we three, both in summer and winter;
for Carlo likes to see us skate on ice, and is fond of a snowballing

<h3><a name="PET" id="PET">PET, THE CANARY.</a></h3>

<p>A little girl by the name of Agnes, who lives in Maine, and who much
enjoys "The Nursery," has a beautiful, bright canary, which her papa
brought her one day in a paper-box. Agnes named him Pet.</p>

<p>The little fellow has become so tame, that he is allowed to stay out of
his cage as long as he wishes, always going to it of his own accord when
bedtime comes. One day I found no pins on my pin-cushion; and, seeing
them scattered around on the bureau, I wondered who could have done the
mischief. I soon found, by watching, that it was Pet's work.</p>

<p>Every day he took his stand on the pin-cushion, in front of the glass,
to pull out all the pins. I saw him once work a long time trying to
stick one back by tipping his head, first one side and then the other,
holding the pin tightly in his bill; but he soon gave it up.</p>

<p>Little Fannie, Agnes's two-year-old sister, often shares her lunch with
him; he sitting on the edge of the saucer, and helping himself while she
is eating. As I write, he is sitting on the tassel of the shade, looking
out of the window. Some day I'll tell you more of Pet's pranks.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CAT_SHOW" id="THE_CAT_SHOW"></a>THE CAT SHOW.</h3>


<p>It was at the Crystal Palace, in Sydenham, England. I wish all the
readers of "The Nursery" could have seen it.</p>

<p>There were over three hundred cats in cages. Each one had a nice red
cushion in the front-part of the cage, and in the back part a dish of
water or milk. Each one had a ribbon around the neck, to which was
attached a medal with the number of the cage. The ribbons were of all
colors.</p>

<p>The cats that had taken the first prize were known by a little blue flag
suspended over the front of the cage, and <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>were the largest cats. Very
many of them were lazily sleeping on their cushions, as happy as if they
were in their own homes. They took little notice of the people who were
looking at them; and, as a placard on each cage ordered spectators to
"move on," no one could spend much time in trying to attract their
attention.</p>

<p>I can hardly tell you about all the cats, there were so many,&mdash;some all
white, some all black, and some all yellow; black-and-yellow,
black-and-white, black-and-gray, gray-and-white,
black-and-yellow-and-white; cats with long hair, and cats with short;
cats with tails, and cats without. One large Russian cat, called the
"Czar," was brown, with smooth, short, shining fur, which looked like
seal-skin.</p>

<p>Then there were kittens of all sizes and colors. In one cage was a black
mother-puss, with four perfectly white kittens, their eyes not yet open.
Another black mother had two kittens,&mdash;one black, and one gray. A
black-and-yellow puss had one black, and one yellow kitten.</p>

<p>In some of the cages were two or three large kittens having a good time
together. Some of them had balls to play with; some were climbing on the
sides of the cage or frolicking with one another; and others were
running around after their tails, in real kitten fashion.</p>

<p>Just before five o'clock, the baskets in which the cats were brought
were placed on the tops of the cages. Some of the cats reached up and
tried to get hold of them. They all seemed to know that the show was
over, and that they would soon be able to run and jump about, with
plenty of air and space.</p>

<p>I must not forget to tell you how quiet all these cats were. Not one
"Me-ow" was to be heard. When, out of sight of the cages, one would
never have known there was a cat in the building.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
